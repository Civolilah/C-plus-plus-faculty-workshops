# C++ faculty workshops

The repository is based on faculty workshops in OOP C++.

The file c-plus-plus-workshop.sln contains one of workshops and after opening this .sln file you can run the result by pressing CTRL + F5 or F5 or run it from the "Run without debugging" toolbar.

Other exams and projects are stored in the "other workshops" folder where you can check it just by copying the code from the Workshop*.txt file and pasting it into the "Source.cpp" file.

I hope the knowledge I got from it is more than obvious and the understanding of OOP in C++ is at a high level.

Thanks,
Abedin
